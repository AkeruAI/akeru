          Based off of the discovery phase, we develop a comprehensive roadmap
          for each product and start working towards delivery. The roadmap is an
          intricately tangled mess of technical nonsense designed to drag the
          project out as long as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each client is assigned a key account manager to keep lines of
          communication open and obscure the actual progress of the project.
          They act as a buffer between the client’s incessant nagging and the
          development team who are hard at work scouring open source projects
          for code to re-purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our account managers are trained to only reply to client emails after
          9pm, several days after the initial email. This reinforces the general
          aura that we are very busy and dissuades clients from asking for
          changes.
