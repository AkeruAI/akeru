# Open Source Assistant API

This project is an open-source alternative to OpenAI's Assistant API. It provides a powerful, flexible AI model for generating human-like text based on the input provided.

## Features

- Natural language processing and generation
- Can be used for creating applications like chatbots, content creators, and more
- User permissions for thread creation, participation, and deletion

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

Akeru uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as its JavaScript runtime environment, replacing Node.js. Please ensure Bun is installed before you proceed. Additionally, Akeru employs [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com) as its web framework for constructing the backend server.

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/guibibeau/akeru.git
```

2. Install the dependencies

```
bun install

```

3. Start Elysia in development mode with auto-reload on code change

```
bun run dev
```
